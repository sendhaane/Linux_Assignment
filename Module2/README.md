# Module 2 – The Linux Environment

## Overview
This module focuses on working with the Linux environment using command-line utilities.
It covers file handling, text processing, process management, redirection, and basic
networking tools through hands-on commands and assignments.

All commands and outputs were executed and verified on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.

---

## Topics Covered
- Linux file management and searching
- Text processing using utilities like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`
- Input and output redirection
- Process monitoring and control
- Basic Linux networking commands

---

## Assignment Tasks

### 1. List files larger than 1 MB
- Used the `find` command to identify files larger than 1 MB in the current directory.
- The output is redirected to a file for reference.

### 2. Search and replace using `sed`
- Replaced all occurrences of `localhost` with `127.0.0.1` in a configuration file.
- The updated content is saved in a separate file without modifying the original file.

### 3. Log file filtering using `grep`
- Extracted lines containing the keyword `ERROR`.
- Excluded lines containing `DEBUG`.
- Saved the filtered result into an output file.

### 4. Process management
- Identified the process with the highest memory usage using `ps`.
- Terminated the identified process using the `kill` command.

### 5. Networking utilities
- Used Linux networking tools to identify available gateways.
- Displayed the gateways in a sorted manner for better readabilit-
